**Pinterest Shopping List** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TravisHoover/Pinterest-Shopping-List.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TravisHoover/Pinterest-Shopping-List)

An application that will compile a grocery list from your Pinterest recipes.

_Tech Stack_<br>
This is a learning experience for me, so this will likely change <br>
throughout development, but I will be using a MongoDB database, <br>
Node.js for my API and web server, and React.js for the front end.


#### Running the app ####
```
$ npm run dev
$ npm start
```
